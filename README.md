In this Power BI project, I worked with the Data Professional Dataset, which presented challenges due to its unstructured and low-quality nature. 
The project was structured to transform this raw data into meaningful insights through the following steps:

1. Data Importation: The first step involved importing the dataset from an Excel sheet into Power BI. This provided a foundational structure for the subsequent data
   cleaning and analysis.

2. Data Cleaning: Once the data was imported, I focused on cleaning it to ensure accuracy and relevance. This process involved removing unwanted columns and handling
   null values to streamline the dataset. Additionally, I used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to further refine the data, ensuring it was suitable for analysis.

3. Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation: After cleaning the data, I represented the refined dataset through visualizations . This involved creating interactive
   dashboard that effectively communicated the key metrics and trends within the dataset.

4. Insight Derivation: The final phase of the project involved deriving actionable insights from the visualized data. I focused on key metrics such as the average salary
   by sex and profession, as well as employees' happiness with their salary and work-life balance. It provided a comprehensive view of the data.
